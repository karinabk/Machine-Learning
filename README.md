# Machine-Learning
Published esearch paper can be found [here](https://github.com/karinabk/Machine-Learning/blob/master/paper.pdf). Practice in Machine Learning ( Deep Learning), implementations of algorithms.

## Tools

* Vizualizatoin of CNN - [Digit recognition](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

See requirements.txt

```

```

Create and activate enviroment via anaconda and install all packages required in the requirements.txt

```
conda create yourenvname
source activate yourenvname
```
